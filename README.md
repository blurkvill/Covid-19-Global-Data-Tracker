# 🦠 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project analyzes and visualizes global COVID-19 data trends such as total cases, deaths, and vaccinations. It uses real-world data to explore how the pandemic evolved across different countries and how governments responded. The final deliverable is a Jupyter Notebook report containing analysis, charts, maps, and key insights.
